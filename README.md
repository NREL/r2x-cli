`r2x-cli` is a Rust CLI that discovers Python plugins, composes them into
repeatable pipelines, and manages the Python runtime with `uv`.
It keeps model data and sidecar artifacts together across process boundaries.

## Quick Start

### Install

macOS and Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/NatLabRockies/r2x-cli/releases/latest/download/r2x-installer.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/NatLabRockies/r2x-cli/releases/latest/download/r2x-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
r2x --version
```
